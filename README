Comments: I enjoyed this project as well.
Recursion is hard for me to wrap my brain around but this project really helped with that.
I started to notice patterns once I figured out how it works which helped me to understand.
I actually thought the .path() method for BinaryTree was more difficult than .path() for the regular Tree.
